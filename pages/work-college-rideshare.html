					Working off the knowledge of my first bootcamp, I sought to go to my first hackathon alone at school. I was able to form a team of 4 there and get started on building an idea that focused on civic engagement. Since I love carpooling with people every time I drive to school or back home (250 miles each way, Binghamton University), I brought up the idea of creating a forum where Binghamton University students could post their destinations as passengers and drivers could connect with them.

					The first step of drawing up a design was my first priority and, because of time, the simpler the better. We decided that we wanted to have a star-rating system, pricing, the ability to for drivers and passengers to post their offers, and the ability to connect with each other. We divyâ€™d up the tasks, others were working on the graphic design and the HTML/CSS, while my partner and I were working on the backend. My partner introduced me to a new stack, MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS). This learning curve was huge and I spent a lot of time doing small tutorials while helping my partner. 

					By the end of the hackathon, we were able to have only a rating system and the ability for users to post. A problem that we encountered was feature creeping. As we kept building, we kept developing new ideas to incorporate other elements. Next time, I will work on finishing a base model as a team and then improving off of that instead of scrambling to incorporate ideas at random times. Also, learning to do the MEAN stack was incredible, as there were so many tools in the stack to scale the application quickly.
