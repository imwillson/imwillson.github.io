					<p>What was used? Swift. GoogleMaps Geometry Library, Google Maps API</p>

					<p>This was a project I made by myself at a iOS Mobile App bootcamp called Make School. In our 8 week program, we were tasked to develop an application that sought to solve problems in our personal lives. As a transit enthusiast, Iâ€™ve always been interested in how friends from outer boroughs with cars (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) could pickup their friends efficiently. I always made my friends walk toward me as I was driving toward them, so I sought to create an application that efficiently did just this. So, instead of sitting in traffic and their standing idly, they could cut down time walking toward me while I was driving toward them.</p>

					<p>I sought to build the backend of the project first. There were so many functions and objects for me to consider when working with the Google Maps Api, my personal algorithm, and data parsing. Quickly, I realized that I needed to build multiple classes to support this project so that my code could be readable and concise.</p>

					<p>It was my first time working with an API and that was challenging to work through documentation and to sort through the data afterward and put it in the JSON format that I wanted. Building the frontend of the application was very challenging as I had not thought much about the user experience when using the application while creating my sketches. </p>

					<p>I learned a lot from building this application. Firstly, that I should always build my front end, at least a basic skeleton of it so that I know what information the user would need. That would define my goals more clearly than just playing with the backend for weeks before realizing that some information was not needed. Secondly, organizing even the most basic functions that are similar to each other into classes helps with code readability immensely. Lastly, I learned that there is a lot of data to be pulled from different companies, but only if documentation is readily available will the information be easily accessible. </p>
