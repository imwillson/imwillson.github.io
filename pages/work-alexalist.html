					What was used? Javascript ,Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Skills,MEANStack

					The goals I had for this second hackathon was to focus on two things: the new hardware Amazon Echo Dot and improving on my skills in the MEAN stack as I saw I had a major interest in forging applications together just to see an idea come to life. With hardware as my focus this time, I quickly developed an idea with my partner to use the Amazon Echo Dot’s voice function to process requests. We decided that we wanted to create a marketplace to post items to sell things and it would be strictly that. 

					Diving head first into the Amazon Echo Dot documentation, we quickly realized that the Amazon Echo Dot was only going to translate our voices into literal text. We utilized one of the functions Amazon Echo Dot - Amazon skills and was able to select a few cue words to increase the functionality of our voice commands. 

					After, I used the mean stack once again to build a simple forum-looking page, so that when we the user said “SELLING” it would add the item onto the page. 

					Working with hardware for the first time was interactive experience that I had never done before. Looking forward to doing more.
