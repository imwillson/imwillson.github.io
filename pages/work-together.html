					What was used?: Python, Flask, Tkinter Library

					This was my first ever project jumping into programming. With a friend, we wanted to solve the problem of college students having to free time in their schedules. So, after a couple rounds of Python syntax learning, we sought to create a running GUI interface that allowed students to input their basic schedule, save that data, process it through our algorithm, and finally display a time.  

					This was my first time building a project, so learning to write an efficient way to convert the schedule times to a format that was easy to compute on was challenging at first, but as I kept iterating the algorithm, I noticed I was constantly converting arrays to strings and then back to arrays-- a lot of redundancy. As a challenge, we also built it on a Flask server to create a database for the inputs and respective output results, so that students could refer back to their results without having to input their schedules again. 

					From this project, I learned to built my first project that had a graphical interface and a database. It was easy to use just one language to build the entire project, however, using Tkinter Library was tedious and felt a bit unintuitive. Next time, I would want to try an interface with HTML/CSS.
